    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Scampi are tiny, lobster-like crustaceans with pale pink shells (also called langoustines). Italian cooks in the United States swapped shrimp for scampi, but kept both names. Thus the dish was born, along with inevitable variations.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste</li>
        <li>1-3/4 pounds of shrimp</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>lemon</li>
        <li>cooked pasta</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine or broth, salt, red pepper flakes and plenty of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Let wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add shrimp and sauté until they just turn pink, 2 to 4 minutes depending upon their size. Stir in the parsley and lemon juice and serve over pasta or accompanied by crusty bread.</li>
        </ol>
